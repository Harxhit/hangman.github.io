# hangman.github.io
A classic Hangman game implemented in Python, which allows players to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. This project showcases fundamental programming skills including control structures, string manipulation, and user interaction through the command line interface.
Key Features:
User Interface:

Command-line interface for player interaction.
Clear instructions provided at the start of the game.
Display of current progress of the word with correctly guessed letters and placeholders for remaining letters.
Display of letters already guessed by the player.
Display of remaining attempts.
Game Logic:

Random word selection from a predefined list.
Input validation to ensure players enter valid and new guesses.
Updating the displayed word as correct letters are guessed.
Tracking of the number of incorrect guesses.
End game conditions: player wins by guessing the word correctly or loses by exceeding the maximum number of incorrect guesses.
Code Structure:

Modular design with functions handling different aspects of the game (e.g., selecting a word, updating the display, checking guesses).
Use of loops and conditionals for game flow control.
Clean and readable code with comments explaining key sections.
Technologies Used:
Python
